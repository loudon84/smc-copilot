# Source Basis

This package integrates the minimal implementation principles formerly split across repository Cursor rules and the Ponytail approach into the canonical SMC Plan contract.

The canonical runtime dependencies are only:

- APPROVED Stage PRD;
- `smc-plan-from-approved-prd-ponytail`;
- `smc-plan-validator`;
- conditional `smc-plan-review` after risk assessment;
- shared SMC architecture/evidence contracts.

`.cursor/rules/plan-codegen-minimal.mdc`, `writing-plans`, and legacy `smc-plan-from-approved-prd` are migration sources only and must not remain active planning owners.
